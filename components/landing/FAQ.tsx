          <AccordionContent>
            Save any Build Mode session as a template. We capture enabled sections, preferred charts, and
            analysis depth. Apply a template to start a new report with the same structure and guidance.

        <AccordionItem value="item-2">
          <AccordionTrigger>What about compliance and auditability?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Every change has provenance and an audit trail. Roles control who can view, edit, or export. Version
            history preserves up to 10 prior states with oneâ€‘click undo.

          <AccordionTrigger>Does my data leave my control?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            No. You choose data sources and permissions during onboarding. Background agents respect these
            controls and only act within your workspace.
